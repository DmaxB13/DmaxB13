# Hi there!
Hellu im DmaxB, im a minecraft nerd and like to program some websites on the side when i feel like it.

## My projects:
- ### iSite:
  iSite is a website for my private Minecraft server MC23. Here you can do many things related to the server and more features coming soon including a big update coming around spring 2026. iSite is primarily made for the people playing on MC23.

- ### DmaxBs Mics and Cams:
    Source code/files for a little resource pack "adding" a mic, a cam and a trophy, all based on Eurovision 2024.
    **Note!** Its only in alpha and in the moment i dont have plans to continue working on the pack, maybe someday.
